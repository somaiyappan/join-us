## Let's hack!

Please answer in the language that you're
applying for. We're a JS shop, so answers in JS
get extra 🍪

- Find the longest word in a string.
  - Given `The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog` is the input to your function, it should return `jumped`.

- Repeat a string `n` times.
  - If `abc` and `3` are the arguments to your function, it shoudl return `abcabcabc`

- Remove duplicates in an array
  - If `[1, 20, 3, 1, 3, 3]` is the input to your
  function, it should return `[1, 20, 3]`

- Remove falsy values
  - If `[42, "everything", "", 2, false, "everything"]` is the input to your function, it should return `[42, "everything", 2, "everything"]`

- Truncate a string
  - If `'Absolute victory'` and `3` are the inputs to
  your function, it should return `Abs...`

## Notes

- Do show off your git kung-fu. Multiple commits? Branch naming?
- If you can't answer everything, thats ok too! Go ahead and raise that PR anyway.
